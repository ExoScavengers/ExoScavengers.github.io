# May 2024 Solar Storms Project

Welcome to the **May 2024 Solar Storms** project! This repository explores the significant solar activity during May 2024, which had widespread effects on Earth and the surrounding space environment. Using real data from NASA missions and citizen science contributions, we analyze the solar storm's impacts on communication systems, satellites, power grids, and more.

## Introduction to Solar Storms and Space Weather

Solar storms are disturbances caused by the Sun's activity, particularly by **solar flares** and **coronal mass ejections (CMEs)**. These events release large amounts of energy and charged particles, which interact with Earth's magnetic field, leading to **space weather** phenomena.

### Key Terms:
- **Solar Flares**: Intense bursts of radiation from the Sun, caused by the sudden release of magnetic energy.
- **Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)**: Large-scale ejections of plasma and magnetic fields from the Sun, which can travel through space and interact with planetary systems.
- **Geomagnetic Storms**: Disruptions in Earth's magnetosphere, often triggered by solar flares and CMEs, which can lead to auroras, communication interference, and satellite malfunctions.

## Overview of May 2024 Solar Storms

In May 2024, the Sun entered a particularly active phase, with several major solar flares and CMEs recorded. These events led to heightened space weather activity, resulting in:
- **Spectacular auroras** visible across a wide range of latitudes, including areas close to the equator.
- **Radio communication and navigation disruptions**, particularly in the polar regions.
- **Satellite malfunctions** in low-Earth orbit, with some satellites forced into safe mode to avoid damage.

### Key Resources:
- **NASAâ€™s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)**: Captured high-resolution images and videos of solar flares.
- **Parker Solar Probe**: Detected solar wind speeds and magnetic field changes, crucial for predicting space weather impacts.
- **SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)**: Confirmed the release of CMEs directed towards Earth.
- **Aurorasaurus**: A citizen science project that gathered real-time reports of aurora sightings during the solar storm.
- **CASSIOPE (Canadian Satellite)**: Collected data on ionospheric activity and auroral phenomena.

## Impacts of Solar Storms

The May 2024 solar storms had significant effects both on Earth and in space:
- **Auroras**: Brilliant auroras were seen far beyond typical regions, thanks to the high level of solar activity.
- **Communication Disruptions**: Geomagnetic storms interfered with satellite-based systems like GPS and radio communications.
- **Satellite Vulnerability**: Space weather caused radiation increases in Earth's orbit, leading to malfunctions and temporary power-downs for satellites.
- **Power Grid Vulnerability**: Geomagnetic storms can induce electric currents in power lines, though no major outages occurred during this event.

## Visuals and Data

We are leveraging data and imagery from NASA's missions and citizen science projects to create:
- **Infographics** on the storm's timeline and impacts.
- **Animations** showing solar flares, CMEs, and the resulting auroras.
- **Interactive tools** to track real-time solar weather events.

## Future Research and Mitigation

The data collected during the May 2024 solar storms will aid in improving future **space weather forecasting** and **satellite protection measures**. We also explore possible solutions to minimize the impact of geomagnetic storms on critical infrastructure, such as satellite shielding and transformer upgrades in power grids.
